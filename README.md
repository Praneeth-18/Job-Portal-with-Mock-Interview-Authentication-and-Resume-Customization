## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local or AWS RDS)
- AWS account (for Cognito and RDS)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job-Portal-with-Resume-Customization.git
cd Job-Portal-with-Resume-Customization
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://ttadmin:yourpassword@your-aws-rds-endpoint:5432/joblistingsportal"

# AWS Cognito Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_ID="us-east-2_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION="us-east-2"

# API Configuration
RESUME_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret"
```

### Install Dependencies

For the main application:
```bash
npm install
```

For the resume service:
```bash
cd resume-service/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the job scraping scripts:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv py311env
source py311env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Components

Follow these steps in order:

#### 1. Job Scraper (Optional, for populating jobs)

Run the job scheduler to scrape and process job listings:
```bash
./run_job_scheduler.sh
```

This script will:
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install required dependencies
- Run the job scraper to populate your database with job listings
- Process the listings and add them to the database

#### 2. Apply Links Processor (Optional)

For processing job application links:
```bash
./fetch_actual_links.sh
```

This script:
- Updates job listings with actual application links
- Improves the accuracy of application redirects

#### 3. Resume Service Backend

Start the resume customization service:
```bash
cd resume-service/backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This service will run on http://localhost:8000

#### 4. Main Application

Finally, start the main Next.js application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## üîÑ Updating Job Listings

The job listings are automatically fetched and updated by the job scheduler. If you need to manually update job listings:

1. Run the job scheduler script:
   ```bash
   ./run_job_scheduler.sh
   ```

2. For processing apply links:
   ```bash
   ./fetch_actual_links.sh
   ```

## üìä AWS RDS Database

The application uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL. Important notes:

- The database connection uses the `ttadmin` user, not the default `postgres` user
- All database operations connect to the RDS instance directly
- Job scraping scripts and the main application both use the same RDS instance
- The database contains job listings, user applications, and interaction history

## üß™ Authentication with AWS Cognito

The application uses AWS Cognito for authentication:

1. Users register through the Register page
2. Verification is sent to their email
3. After verification, users can log in
4. Authentication state is managed through the AuthContext provider

## üìù Resume Customization Service

The resume customization service allows users to:

1. Upload their basic resume
2. Select a job listing to apply for
3. Get an AI-customized resume tailored to that specific job
4. Download the customized resume as a PDF

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Error message `no pg_hba.conf entry for host` - Make sure you're using `ttadmin` username in your connection string, not `postgres`
   - Verify the connection string in your `.env.local` file matches your AWS RDS instance
   - Check security group settings in AWS RDS to allow connections

2. **Application Errors**:
   - For Next.js errors, check the browser console and terminal
   - For Python script errors, check the log files in `scripts/logs/`

3. **Resume Service Issues**:
   - Ensure the Python environment has all required dependencies
   - Check if the service is running on the correct port
